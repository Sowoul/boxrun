# Description:  
This is my first game ever, developed using unity, with huge inspiration and help from the channel [Brackeys](https://www.youtube.com/@Brackeys)  
The game doesnt have huge mechanics or graphics or anything for that matter, you are, as the game suggests, a block that runs.
For pc, the controls are pretty basic, W S A D for motion, and space for jumps.
For android, its the swipes in the respective directions.

Sorry for the choppy footage, I have no clue why it receored in low fps.
